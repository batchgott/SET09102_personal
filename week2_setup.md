# Setup

This section documents your practical work in week 2.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

The first thing that needs to be done to set up the development environment is to download or update Visual Studio. The easiest way to do that is by using the Visual Studio Installer (Fig.1).

We also need to click on *Modify* and and add the **.NET Multi-platform App UI development (MAUI)** workload to the Visual Studio installation.

After Visual Studio is installed and up-to-date we can launch it and use the option "Clone a repository" to get started. Here we can paste the URL to our repository and clone it as can be seen in Fig.3.

Once the cloning is completed the IDE should open and show all the project files (Fig.4). To run the application you need to click on "Windows Machine".

Before the application gets started you will be prompted a window where you need to enable Developer Mode (Fig.5).

Now the MAUI App should open (Fig.6).

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
